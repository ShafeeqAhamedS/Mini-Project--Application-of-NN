## Project Title:
<h1 align="center">Prediction of Liver Cirrhosis</h1>

## Project Description:
### About Liver Cirrhosis
* Chronic liver damage from a variety of causes leading to scarring and liver failure.
* Hepatitis and chronic alcohol abuse are frequent causes.
* Liver damage caused by cirrhosis can't be undone, but further damage can be limited.
* Initially patients may experience fatigue, weakness and weight loss.
* During later stages, patients may develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin), gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal swelling and confusion.
### About the dataset
* This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. 
* The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). 
* This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.
### Goal of the Project
* The main aim of the project is to create a ANN model which classifies patients as Infected or not infected based on various protiens in the blood.
* By using the simple blood tests we can predict whether he is infected or not.
